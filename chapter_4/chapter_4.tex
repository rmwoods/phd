\chapter{Code Tests}
\label{chap:codetests}
\thispagestyle{fancy}

In this chapter, I present a variety of tests to demonstrate the strengths and limitations of the above algorithm. Many tests cases have been drawn from previous RT papers including \citet{ilievEt06,gendelevKrumholz12,skinnerOstriker13}. This chapter also include tests of accuracy and scaling of the algorithm.

\section{Glass}
\label{sec:glass}

A glass of particles is a simple way to demonstrate the most basic functionality of the algorithm. Each particle effectively acts to sample the radiation field at a particular point and has an easily calculated exact solution to compare to. A glass is also the relaxed state for an SPH simulation

\subsection{Optically Thin}
\label{sec:thinglass}

{TAKE THIS SECTION OUT? TOO SIMPLE?}

In the optically thin case, we simply want to ensure that we obtain a $1/r^2$ dropoff with flux. There should be no errors present in this test case because in the case of a single source, no averaging is needed and both exact luminosity and position of the source is used for every sink.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:flux}
F = \frac{L}{4\pi r^2}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Optically Thick}
\label{sec:thickglass}

{TAKE THIS SECTION OUT? TOO SIMPLE?}

Like section \ref{sec:thinglass}, this section aims to demonstrate the base ability of the code. In this case, the glass of particles has a roughly homogeneous density and thus the flux is still easily calculated for comparison.

\begin{itemize}
\item The equation for flux in this case is still fairly simple. If we refer to equation \ref{eq:radabsorption}, we can see the theoretical flux is simply equation \ref{eq:flux} multiplied by the exponential of optical depth. See equation \ref{eq:thickflux}.
\item This assumes a homogeneous density field. The glass does not have an exactly homogeneous field, but has little variance from the average.
\item Figure \ref{fig:thickglasserrors} shows the error distribution of the particles.
\item Note that in the case that the density field is exact, the errors reduce down to machine precision. This emphasizes the importance of accurately modeling the density distribution.
\end{itemize}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:thickflux}
F = \frac{L}{4\pi r^2} \exp{-\tau}
\end{equation}

\section{Multi-Source Glass}
\label{sec:multiglass}

We now show the effect of including many sources. The code is now performing at its most ``stressed;'' having a large number of randomly distributed sources means the code will run at its slowest and will include a large amount of averaging (not quite right).

\begin{itemize}
\item We first present the optically thin case. In this case, the glass has had half of its gas particles replaced with sources so that there are an equal number of each.
\item The error distribution present in this
\end{itemize}

\section{Effects of Averaging the Source}
\label{sec:averagingsource}

We now look closely at what effects averaging sources can have on results.

\subsection{Two star}

\subsection{Isothermal Sphere with a Cluster(?)}
\label{sec:cluster}

Words

\section{The Str\"omgren Sphere}
\label{sec:stromgren}

The str\"omgren sphere is a theoretical ionized sphere of gas. It was first discussed by Bengt Str\"omgren in 1938 \citep{stromgren39}. We start with a cloud of homogeneous neutral Hydrogen gas and an ionizing source, commonly representing an O or B-type star, at the center. As the photons from the source ionize the hydrogen, the optical depth of the gas decreases, and so the ionizing photons move further out creating an ionization front. As the front moves out, the photon density as a function of radius falls off simply due to $1/r^2$ geometry and eventually a point is reached where the ionization rate falls to the recombination rate. At this point, the front stops in equilibrium.

One can solve for this radius by setting the photon density as a function of radius to the recombination rate and solving for radius \citep{stromgren39,spitzer78},

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:stromgrenradius}
R_S = \left( \frac{3}{4\pi} \frac{\dot{N_{\gamma}}}{\alpha n_H^2}\right).
\end{equation}

One can also find the growth rate of the front,

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:stromgrentime}
R(t) = R_S[1-\exp{(t/t_{\mbox{recomb}})}]^{1/3}.
\end{equation}

The above equations are the solutions for the evolution of a sharp ionization front, meaning that we have assumed the transition from ionized to neutral is infinitesimal in size. In order to solve for a non-sharp front, we must solve some equations numerically. FILL IN METHOD HERE.

\subsection{The Isothermal Case}
\label{sec:isostromgren}

In the simplest case, the ionizing source is assumed to emit photons at exactly 13.7 ev, meaning that the hydrogen gas is ionized but not heated. Cooling is also disabled, meaning that the gas is isothermal. If we assume that the ionization front propagates until the ionization rate drops low enough (due to geometric diminishment) to equal the recombination rate of the ambient medium, then we can solve for the equilibrium ionization radius by setting the two rates equal.

The ionization rate per unit volume can be written as the (fill in here)

%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:fluxrecomb}
%F = \int_0^{r_s} n_e n_H \alpha_B(T) dl,
%\end{equation}
%
%where $n_e$ is the number density of electrons, $n_H$ is the number density of neutral Hydrogen, $\alpha_B$ is the case B recombination coefficient for Hydrogen for a given temperature, and $r_s$ is the equilibrium radius or ``Str\"omgren radius.'' 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:strmogrenradius}
R_S = \left( \frac{3}{4\pi} \frac{\dot{N_{\gamma}}}{\alpha n_H^2}\right)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:stromgrentime}
R(t) = R_S[1-\exp{(t/t_{\mbox{recomb}})}]^{1/3}
\end{equation}

The above derivation assumes a ``sharp'' ionization front, meaning the transition from ionized to neutral is across an infinitesimal region. In practice, the transition region is small compared to the size of the ionized region, but there is structure interior to the Str\"omgren radius that is not accounted for by simply solving for the equilibrium radius. In order to solve for a non-sharp ionization front, we must integrate the above ionization equations \citep{osterbrockFerland2006}. (ADD HERE). In the following tests, we include both the sharp and non-sharp ionization front solutions for comparison to our results.

We follow the initial conditions of \citet{ilievEt2006}; the medium is initially neutral with a temperature 1e5 K and a density of 1e-3 cm$^{-3}$. An ionizing source is turned on at t = 0 that emits $\dot{N} = 5e48$ photons s$^{-1}$ at 13.6 ev. We use a cross section $\sigma = 6.3e-18 cm^2$ and a recombination rate of $\alpha = 2.59e-13 cm^{-3} s^{-1}$, typical of 1e5 K gas. These values give a Str\"omgren radius of 5.38 kpc and a recombination time of 125 Myr.

\end{figure}

\subsection{The Thermal Case}
\label{sec:thermalstromgren}

The above formulation assumed the gas was isothermal in order to simplify assumptions about cross section and recombination. In reality, both change with temperature. As well, the incoming photons are typically not all at a single wavelength but are distributed among many. The following test accounts for the latter factor, though not the former.

In this test, the incident photons are assumed to be from a black body with temperature 1e5 K. The cross section is changed to an integrated cross section, obtained by integrating the cross section as a function of wavelength over all wavelengths having energies between 13.6 ev and 29.65 ev.

\section{The Gas Wall}
\label{sec:gaswall}

In order to test the algorithm's ability to handle a sharp density jump, we again perform the isothermal stromgren front (section \ref{sec:isostromgren}), but with a large density jump. We keep all of the same initial parameters, but change the density to the left of x = 0 to $\rho/2$ and the density to the right of x = 0 to $3/2 \rho$.

\subsection{Only Radiation}
\label{sec:gaswallradonly}

In the case that hydrodynamics is off, the solution is two stromgren hemispheres centered at x = 0.

\subsection{With Hydrodynamics - the Champagne Flow}
\label{sec:champagne}

In order to test the coupling of radiation to the hydrodynamics, we perform a similar test in which the code now uses its hydrodynamics solvers. We follow the setup of \citet{gendelevKrumholz12}; A 50 pc cube is initialized with a density of 0.055 atoms cm$^{-3}$ to the right of x = 0, and 63 atoms cm$^{3}$ to the left. The temperatures of the left and right halves are 55 K and 6.3e3 K, respectively. This density/temperature combination gives pressure equilibrium at the boundary. An ionizing source is turned on at the origin that emits 5.3e47 photons/s, similar to a type BO.5 star. The combination of density and luminosity gives a stromgren sphere radius of 1.5 pc in the dense regions and a recombination time of 2.48e4 Years. The simulation is run for more than 4e6 years, meaning that the gas has time to heat and expand.
