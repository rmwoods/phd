%%%                        setspace.sty.  The main aspects of this
%%%                        modification deal with the definitions of
%%%                        \doublespacing, \onehalfspacing, and
%%%                        \singlespacing (these are near the beginning of
%%%                        the file).  Primarily, these deal with adding
%%%                        fontsize changes to guarantee that the new
%%%                        baseline is properly defined and placed into
%%%                        action.  The extra \vskip in the definition of
%%%                        \singlespacing seems to  make for a cleaner
%%%                        transition from multiple spacing back to single
%%%                        spacing.  These did not appear warrranted for

%% FILE:   setspace.sty in SYS2.TEX.PUB.ISULATEX.STYLES
%% AUTHOR: Erica M. S. Harris
%% DATE:   April 1990
%% MOD:    March 1991
%% DESCR:  LaTeX Document style option "setspace"
%%         Usage:  \documentstyle[...,setspace,...]{...}
%%         Based on the doublespace option created by Stephen Page.
%%
%%         This style option provides commands and environments for doing
%%         double and  one-and-a-half spacing based on pt size.
%%
%%         Single spacing is the default.
%%
%%         Three commands, \doublespacing, \onehalfspacing, and
%%         \singlespacing, are for use in the preamble to set the overall
%%         spacing for the document.  If a different spacing is required then
%%         the \setstretch{baselinestretch} command can be used in the
%%         preamble to set the baselinestretch appropriately.  The default
%%         spacing with this style option is single spacing.
%%
%%         Three environments, singlespace, onehalfspace, and doublespace,
%%         allow the spacing to be changed within the document.  Both the
%%         onehalfspace and doublespace environments are intended to increase
%%         the spacing, so the onehalfspace environment should not be used in
%%         a double spaced document.  If an increased spacing different from
%%         one-and-a-half or double spacing is required then the spacing
%%         environment can be used.  The spacing environment takes one
%%         argument which is the larger baselinestretch to use,
%%         e.g., \begin{spacing}{2.5}.
%%
%%         \footins is adjusted the same as \parskip - appears to work. Lose
%%         stretch parts but don't consider that to be crucial
%%
%%         Removed code for altering spacing before and after displayed
%%         equations - just looked too much.
%%
%% MODS:
%%         Redefinition of \spacing and \endspacing for consistency with
%%         TeX 3.x inserted by George Greenwade.  Modification provided by
%%         Philip Ross (ROSS@UK.AC.ABDN.BIOMED) and John Byrne via INFO-TeX.
%%
%% PLEASE REPORT ANY BUGS
%%
%%   Old Documentation follows:
%%         1. A new environment "singlespace" is provided, within which single
%%            spacing will apply.
%%            JFL - changed so that it works in regular text and so that
%%            vertical space before and after is correctly computed
%%         2. Double spacing is turned off within footnotes and floats (figures
%%            and tables).
%%         3. Proper double spacing happens below tabular environments and in
%%            other places where LaTeX uses a strut.
%%         4. Slightly more space is inserted before footnotes.
%%         5. JFL - fixes spacing before and after displayed math

%%            lamy@ai.toronto.edu
%%            lamy@utai.uucp
%%
%% POSSIBLE BUGS:
%%    . Increasing struts may possibly cause some other obscure part of
%%      formatting to fall over.
%%    . \begin{singlespace}\begin{quote} produces the wrong spacing before
%%      the quote (extra glue is inserted).
