Chapter 4 of this thesis all represent original papers written by
myself, Rory Woods and published in the \textit{Monthly
Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society}.  Co-authors on these
manuscripts are Dr. James Wadsley, Dr. Hugh Couchman, and Dr. Greg Stinson.  This
work, however, has been reformatted to conform to the required thesis
style.  I grant an irrevocable, non-exclusive license to McMaster
University and the National Library of Canada to reproduce this
