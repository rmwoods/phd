A New Method for Fast Approximate Radiative Transfer; James Wadsley (McMaster University, Canada) 

Co-Authors: Rory Woods (McMaster University, Canada); Hugh Couchman (McMaster University, Canada) 

We present a new scheme for radiative transfer. The goals are a fast approach (low cost, no timestep constraints) for an approximate radiation field to drive chemistry and heating for many potential applications. The method combines ray tracing and the tree method. It is flexible in terms of geometry and can use multiple wave-bands. It has been implemented in the GASOLINE2 code but is modular and could be added to different code types. The result scales well with source numbers and is cheap for sub-regions (i.e. multiple timesteps). We demonstrate test results for ionizing radiation (HII regions) and shadowing tests. We show first results on some astrophysical applications.

N_sources, N_sinks, total N = N_sources + N_sinks  box size L
Cost: O(N_sink log N_source) -- Luminosities
 int 4 pi r^2/(theta^3 r^3/L^3) dr ~ 4 pi/theta^3 (log L - log (L/N^1/3))
    ~ 4 pi/3 theta^-3 Log N

Minimum climb up -- upper bound on work x Log N_total
  sink+source -- distance r, tree cell size ~ r 
  Like a two sides opening angle -- keep angle
  subtended to sink AND to source less than theta_Def
    theta_def s.t.  d_cell/r ~ 1

Refinement criteria:
  Assume beam angle that subtended by source to sink
  refine to this size at all intermediate distances:
     cost ~ log r - log L/N^1/3 = log (r/L N^1/3)
 int 4 pi r^2/(theta^3 r^3/L^3) log(r/L N^1/3) dr
   still x Log N total -- may be more or less work depending on theta

May need to do some averaging to get effective opacities
on scale of cell
exp(-tau_avg) = Average weighted by area of subcell exp(-tau), subcell
This depends on size of cell, not just kappa
Should do some Monte Carlo to prove behaviour?
  OR refine like crazy (not desirable)
In limit of small optical depths -- equivalent to avg kappa

Should dt be s.t. delta kappa is small in one step?
  cf. c2ray discussion
  c2ray does projection forward of ionization fractions over step
  --> only possible if you have a reasonable guess for the field
     otherwise may need to iterate
     iterating kills most advantages of method
   ** May need a timestep criterion associated w/ ionization
      to make sure ionization front particles on smallest steps

Most other workers use on the spot approx -- need to handle
   re-emission scattering (dust contributes too?)
  -- Special integration approaches that are stable with gas sources
     (Can't emit more than you have even when dt large)

Advantages:  multiple timesteps -- cost proportional to n_active
   not n_source

Zoom-in -- do background with shell of sources
  Note that flux only sensible for r << r_shell
   -- math

For filled periodic box, something like Gnedin/otvet trick
  do 1 periodic replica
  for final cell, replace w/ background L \propto cell area subtended x Flux
