\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:intro} 
\thispagestyle{fancy} 

It doesn't take much to convince a physicist of the importance of photons - astrophysical object speak in photons. As astronomers, we receive all of our information in the universe through photons. In order to understand the objects we observe, we must understand photons; how are they created? How are they removed? What processes can alter a photon?

\section{Astrophysics and Radiation}
\label{sec:astroandrad}

It is useful to start by considering the available bands of photons in astronomy that have important effects on gas.

\begin{itemize}
\item Introduce stellar systems -  radiation can provide pressure support, can cause ionization, dissociation, can heat the gas. Because gas properties tied to star formation rate, and stars are one of the primary targets of observation, it's important to know what's going on.
\item Introduce cosmology (how in depth here?). Cosmology depends on knowing photon history and what cosmological factors affect photons. Introduce cosmic reionization, Universe expansion, SZ?, lensing?, CMB?
\item Need to ability to track photoionization, photoheating across huge amounts of sources and their environments. Astrophysical radiation has both short and large scale effects that can't be ignored.
\end{itemize}

\section{Overview}

Chapter \ref{chap:radtransfer} will go over the background of radiative transfer and the currently available codes that solve the radiative transfer problem. It will also motivate the need for a new code in a particular niche. Chapter \ref{chap:method} will introduce the new radiative transfer method that we have developed. Chapter \ref{chap:codetests} will demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of the new algorithm through a variety of numerical and phyical tests. Chapter \ref{chap:galaxyformation} will show the results of using the algorithm on an isolated galaxy in the FUV band, and will also focus on future projects that the algorithm will be used for. Finally, chapter \ref{chap:conclusion} contains the conclusions of this thesis.
