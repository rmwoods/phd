 Note good for re-ionization (reduced light speed), lines
Main features:
  -- challenges: 1) 7d  2) timescale c ~ 1000 c_s
  -- M1 method, lose 2 dim (angles)  M1 closure, Levermore '84
   -- 1st order Godunov
   -- Crossing beams: nasty!
   -- No limit to sources: e.g. rotating disk w/ stars model, 300 Myr
  -- Reduced light speed: c_red = c/1000  comparable to hydro
    c.f. Gnedin+Abel 2001
    As long as ionization front speed captured ok
  -- Freq bins -- extra eqns
  -- Non-eqm chemistry  "most codes don't" -- really?
  -- Radiation pressure dp/dt ~ L_UV/c
    -- assess correctness of subgrid models
  -- Multi-scattering:  dp/dt ~ L_opt/c tau_IR
    -- diffusion, need to resolve mean free path or photons leave

      case diffusion error in adv. is larger than true diffusion
  Jiang: use a different solver

Intermittency of sources
  JW: must be modulated by recombination radiation

LM: Ramses-RT only factor of 2 slower than normal Ramses
    --> lot more memory required  
    --> 5 photon groups, 4 variables each vs. 6 for hydro in ramses

VS: Direct rad p -- not much effect
    Boost w/ IR (tau<10) -- not much effect

Joachim Stadel + Christian Reinhardt
 Doing moon forming planet collisions w/ Gasoline
 Interesting work on EOS noise issues
 Split energy Hydro into PdV + Shock
   Shock done at kick
   PdV done at drift following exact density 
    -- using tabulated EOS
    -- tricky because no analytic entropy defined to conserve
 Cool results:
  clumping structures forming in ejecta
  Res dependence?
  EOS has negative pressure -- tensile instability
 Issue with density systematic at edge of planet
  --> correct using empirical estimate of active volume
  --> Nice sharp density at edge
    (I mentioned drho/dt approach)
 --> Offered latest Gasoline to play with -- RTFORCE
 Iterested in P+P/(rho_i rho_j) stuff
   interested in Lagrangian derivations -- pointed at Hopkins 2013
   Main difference is kernel avg vs. weighted avg.

To Tom: 

Joachim and his student are doing cool stuff with planet collisions.
Currently they are using a relatively old Gasoline.  I am going to get them connected to Ben's code.  

They have done cool stuff with EOS and solids stuff.  Joachim is also doing GENGA and Pkdgrav3 which can handle trillion particle runs.  Pkdgrav3 is now using GPU and full FMM and scales very well.  Thus there is a lot here and things of mutual benefit to exchange.  My sense is that Joachim's focus with pkdgrav3+ will always be being faster and bigger and this fundamentally excludes bringing more physics into that code.  However, with his student using GASOLINE he has lots of incentive to make GASOLINE/CHANGA better right now.

Lucio is doing all sorts of things (e.g. galaxies, CGM, feedback).  His student David is doing some very high res disks looking at early galaxies and AGN formation. As part of their radiative transfer consortium Lucio has Ali Rahmati (TRAPHIC) as a postdoc whose tasks include putting TRAPHIC Radiative
Transfer into GASOLINE.  I told Ali we were already tweaking GASOLINE to make a cleaner interface for cooling and Rory's RT.  I told him I'd help but that 
we should really consider transitioning everything to CHANGA.  I only had an hour or two to talk with him.  In the end the suggestion was to do things in the most
straightforward way, getting used to our nbr list approach and then consider
optimization and migration later. 

Another thing is they have a few ideas about public release/documentation.  In particular, we need to consolidate documentation and make it public.  Something I wasn't fully aware of is that the broader group also wants quite detailed code documentation so they can understand units and what is going on.  This could be addressed with Doxygen but also detailed descriptions of what output files contain and so forth.  I think we need a central, official wiki where editing can be opened up and then people like Lucio's students would happily help extend it to add these details.

Joachim mentioned that you were considering a visit to Zurich.   With so much going on it seems like a productive idea if I visit around the same time and they were pretty keen on this.  Joachim didn't mention a specific time but indicated maybe this summer.  I am away in August but I might be able to visit earlier with the caveat that there are thesis defences and things coming up.   Lucio suggested January (during their 1 week break) and getting in some skiing.  That would work better for me since I can reschedule my grad teaching for that term for 1 week pretty easily.
