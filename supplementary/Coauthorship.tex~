Chapters 2, 3, 4, and 5 of this thesis all represent original papers written by
myself, Nathan W. C. Leigh and published in the \textit{Monthly
Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society}.  Co-authors on these
manuscripts are Dr. Alison Sills, and Dr. Christian Knigge.  This
work, however, has been reformatted to conform to the required thesis
style.  I grant an irrevocable, non-exclusive license to McMaster
University and the National Library of Canada to reproduce this
material as part of this thesis.
