Ricotti, Gnedin, + Shull, 2002
OTVET for cosmological galaxy formation, H2 LyWerner. Chemistry for H2 formation/destruction, molecular + atomic cooling, ionization by secondary electrons, and heating by Ly Alpha scattering. "We find that the first galaxies (``small-halo galaxies'') are characterized by bursting star formation, self-regulated by a feedback process that acts on cosmological scales. The mass in stars produced by these objects can exceed the mass in stars produced by normal galaxies; therefore, their impact on cosmic evolution cannot be neglected."

Razoumov, A., Scott, D., MNRAS
Suggest ray tracing is best suited for astrophysics. Algorithm combines advection of radiation with implicit solution of local rate equations (super slow?).

Altay and Theuns, MNRAS.
URCHIN, reverse ray tracer. Optimized to model self shielding in cosmological sims. Cast rays from each sink and get optical depth (using healpix for nrays). Scales as Nsink*Nray. Nray ~ 12 for cosmological simulations? Seems low. Use background UV field (as a function of z, from e.g. Haardt and Madau).
